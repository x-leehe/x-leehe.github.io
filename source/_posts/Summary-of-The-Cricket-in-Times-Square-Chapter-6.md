Today is the day that Mario took Chester Cricket to Chinatown to buy a cricket cage. Mario put the cricket into a matchbox, and then put the matchbox on the chest so the cricket could see out. This is the first time Chester the cricket could see what's happening in the subway. Chester is such a curious cricket that he said as much as it could.

In Chinatown, as Mario's dad said, all the shops were closed. However, the shop SAI FONG is still open. It was Sai Fong smoking with his clay pipe when Mario went to the especially old shop. Sai Fong was poor at English, but he still managed to make Mario understand him. Sai Fong told the story of Hsi Shuai, too.

At last, Mario decided to buy the cage. Sai Fong sold the cage for fifteen cents, which is affordable to Mario.
