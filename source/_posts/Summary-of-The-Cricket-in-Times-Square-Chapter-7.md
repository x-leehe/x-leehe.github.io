That night, Chester shared his experience in Chinatown with Tucker and Harry at his "pagoda".
 
Harry thought that it was very funny for people in Chinatown to make soup out of the bird's nests, shark fins, or even to make a souffle out of a mouse, although he liked Chinese dishes. And then Tucker began to speak out.
 
Tucker said that Harry didn't know his own strength. And then he admired Chester's "pagoda". But Chester didn't like it. Instead, he was more likely to be free. Harry and Chester then got him out of the cage, and Tucker was admitted by Chester to stay in it for a while. At first it was like Tucker had fallen into someone's trap, but after Harry and Chester's decoration, they made the "pagoda" more beautiful than before. Tucker was so happy that he sang in the "pagoda".
