This is a story between 2 human beings: Mario, his friend Paul, and a mouse called Tucker.

It is a night when Mario is selling newspapers and magazines in the newsstand. There is no business though, because there is no one buying their newspapers or magazines, not even the time to look back. All evening long he had sold only fifteen papers and four magazines. But thanks to his friend Paul, he eventually managed to sell a ‘Sunday Times’, but Paul got into the train too.

The mouse, Tucker, was on the sidelines, watching everything and smiled because of Paul. Suddenly the mouse heard a very strange noise that he didn’t usually hear, which is the sound of the cricket Chester.
