It was Sunday when Mario got up early in the morning. It's kind of strange since Mario often sleeps late on Sundays. The cricket didn't sleep either. Mario and his father thought it must like it here, for it didn't escape at night.

For the cricket coming from countryside, everything is unusual. Back in the countryside it usually eat leaves, grass and pieces of tender bark, but here in New York it was eating bread and candy and liverwurst.

Mario wrapped the cricket in a piece of wrapped paper, and then showed the cricket to the counterman Micky. Mario then asked for a glass of water at that moment to let the cricket drink water from it. What's more, they gave the cricket soda.

The funny thing is that Mario even wants the cricket to learn music. And Mario's dad was fairly happy with hopelessness.
