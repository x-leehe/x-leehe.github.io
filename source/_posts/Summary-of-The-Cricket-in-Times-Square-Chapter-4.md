Chester the Cricket was scared at that time. But it was the cat that turned out to be Tucker the mouse's best friend. The Cat was named Harry who lives peacefully with the mouse Tucker. The cat said that they maybe formed the habit of catching the mouse, but not so when they come to this city.

Tucker asked Chester to make some noise, and Chester did it too. The cat said the noise, or the music, made him to 'purr' when hearing it.

When it comes to going home or staying in New York for a while, Chester mentioned that he didn't know how to get home. Tucker has a number of ideas, but he recommended Chester to stay for a try.

Tucker took Chester to look around the city, and Chester was speechless with great surprise. Chester gradually had a strong feeling of something strange.
