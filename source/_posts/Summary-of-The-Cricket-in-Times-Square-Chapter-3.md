Now it is Tucker Mouse that noticed Chester Cricket. He went by, shared some food with Chester, and started talking with Chester.

Chester embarked on the journey to New York about three days ago. He was sitting on his stump when he smelled something. He then jumped into the picnic basket without the notice of the people, and began his feast of gluttony. After this, he slept in the basket. Just then somebody put a bag on him. That’s how he went in New York.

Although he had never been to New York before this, he heard about it. Tucker Mouse sympathized with Chester’s plight. Just then a cat came towards them. Chester hid himself inside the match box.
